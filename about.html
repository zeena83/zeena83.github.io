    <h3> Who are we </h3>
    <p>Kaffelicious is a quality-focused, community hub located in coastal san diego county.  Lofty was started in 2011  as a corner cafe on historic coast hwy 101 in encinitas, california. “our ethos”,  was the guiding vision for the original cafe and continues to guide us as we grow. In the five years since our founding, we have expanded to three locations including a production facility where we roast our coffee and bake our pastries from scratch. Sourcing organic ingredients from local producers keeps our breakfast and lunch menus full of fresh and healthy options. Running our business in a sustainable manner is of equal importance to our commitment to producing quality products. As a locally owned business, we are committed to providing our community with superior coffee, artisanal food and exceptional customer service. We don’t need to write your name on a cup because we already know it.</p>
